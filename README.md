# Hi! I'm Matin
### programmer and software engineer.
The areas of my activity are as follows:
- Build and develop various interesting hardware/software projects.
- Research and study in various fields of computers/technology.
- Production of programming content. [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@MatinAfzal)
- Creation of various open-source projects for the growth of the programming community.

I started working with KaliLinux at the age of 15, and I researched and learned penetration testing tools such as SqlMap, Nmap, Metasploit, and many others. I continued this path and at the age of 20, I found myself writing my 3D rendering engine.
