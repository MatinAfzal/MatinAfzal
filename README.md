Hello! 
I am Matin, a <strong>programmer and software engineer</strong>.

My interest is in computer software/hardware.
I spend most of my time programming, researching, and learning in related fields.
You can find a list of my projects in the following readme.

My fields of activity include <strong>programming and developing different software, machine learning, machine vision, artificial intelligence, data science, penetration testing</strong> etc.
I started at the age of 15 when I started working with KaliLinux and researched and learned penetration testing tools such as SqlMap, Nmap, Metasploit, and many others.
